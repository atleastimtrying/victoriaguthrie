        <h1 class="blogpost">The &lsquo;C&rsquo; word: Conversion</h1>
          <p class="blogpost">Understanding what a conversion is (and how to get one) is an important element of any business. This relatively simple concept is a huge part of most, if not all, businesses. A conversion is a marketing term &ndash; the act of someone doing what it is you want them to do. </p>

        </blockquote>
          <p>Lets have a look at a fictional glove company. Gloves R Us produce gloves (handy, eh?). Here are some examples of how this company may get conversions via different methods:</p>
          <h4>Blog</h4>
          <p><strong>Conversion:</strong> User subscribing to receive updates or getting in touch via the blog.
          Gloves R Us have just posted on their blog about the benefits of wearing gloves in the cold weather. It&rsquo;s a really interesting, useful post that provides the user with lots of practical information. The user thinks the Gloves R Us blog is worth subscribing to because it is regularly updated with offers, informative articles with links to other interesting things and useful information. The user signs up to receive the monthly newsletter. This establishes a regular connection between Gloves R Us and their customers which allows them to increase brand awareness and encourage brand loyalty.</p>
          <h4>Twitter</h4>
          <p><strong>Conversion:</strong> A retweet or a follow.
          Gloves R Us have have been tweeting about their new blog post on the history of gloves. A user finds this particularly interesting and wants to be updated on what else Gloves R Us have to say. The user starts following the Gloves R Us twitter account; this is one more user who will be receiving tweets about the business and any offers that are running.</p>
          <p>By retweeting a post, the user is choosing to interact and thinks the information offered is interesting or valuable enough to share with others. By posting about the history of gloves, Gloves R Us are presenting themselves as an authority on the subject which gives implied value and in turn presents them as a more trusted supplier than others. Social media is a way of adding value to your company &ndash; people feel better buying from the best. By providing valuable content Gloves R Us tweets are more likely to be shared and retweeted.</p>
          <h4>E-commerce site</h4>
          <p><strong>Conversion:</strong> User purchasing a product.
          A user visits the Gloves R Us website and purchases a pair of leather gloves. </p>
          <p>Although the actual conversion can vary from business to business, the principle of measuring conversions remains the same. Much emphasis is often placed on the amount of visitors to a website. If five out of 100 visitors purchased gloves from the Gloves R Us site that would be five conversions and a 5% conversion rate. Although more visitors to a website as a good thing, it&rsquo;s the conversion rate that really counts. It is common practice for businesses to spend more money trying to get people to visit their site rather than convert (which is what brings the money in). It is better to have 5 people out of 50 convert than 5 people out of 1000.</p>
          <p>If you have an e-commerce site a conversion is relatively straightforward. It will be the act of a user purchasing one of your products. For a website that is for lead generation (like my own) the conversion would be the act of a user getting in touch via the contact form or calling to ask for a quote. For social media endeavours like Facebook or Twitter pages it can be more difficult to decide on what a conversion is (for your business is it a &lsquo;like&rsquo;? A comment? A retweet? Feedback on a service? Or even a complaint?). Conversions are important because they are what help to generate business.</p>
          <h4>How and why do I measure it?</h4>
          <p>It&rsquo;s very important to measure your conversions because this can tell you how successful your campaign is. You can use fancy-pants technology like <a href="http://www.googleanalytics.com">Google Analytics</a> to track conversions from your website and interactions on social media like Facebook, Twitter and G+. Alternatively, you could keep account of conversions the old-fashioned way by keeping score of how many sales you get or how many people get in touch using the contact form on your site.
          Keeping track of conversions is an essential part of finding out how successful content changes are as you can easily compare the conversion rate before and after any changes using Google Analytics.</p>
          <h4>How can a copywriter help people to convert?</h4>
          <p>It is a copywriter&rsquo;s job to make it as easy and attractive as possible for potential buyers or clients to convert. A copywriter will achieve this by crafting succinct, relevant copy that is clear and persuasive and tells the reader what they need to know.</p>
