        </p><p class="blogpost">When writing for the web it is important to keep your copy relatively short. By writing short, succinct copy you can maximise the amount of SEO rich keywords words. Secondly, the last thing your reader wants is to scroll through pages and pages of copy to find the information they need. It&rsquo;s a well known fact that readers on the web are impatient. They want the information there and then. If they can&rsquo;t find it straight away, they&rsquo;ll look for it elsewhere. </p>
          

          <h4>Headline</h4>
          <p>This small piece of text will be the most-read part of your web page/blog post. Readers and search engines alike see the information on a page as a hierarchy. The top of the page is seen as holding the most importance; the further down the page you go, the less important the information becomes. This means it&rsquo;s important to grab your reader&rsquo;s attention with a short and snappy headline. Be direct and clear &ndash; tell your readers exactly what they&rsquo;ll be looking at.</p>
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The introduction should be used to encourage your reader to continue reading the rest of the article. Now is the time to answer your reader&rsquo;s burning question &ndash; how can you benefit them? Your introduction needs to talk directly to your reader and include all the most important information: What? Where? Why? Who? When? The key here is making sure that you provide information that is useful. Now is the time to get them hooked and make them want to keep on reading.</p>
          <h4>Body copy</h4>
          <p>Well done, you&rsquo;ve got your reader to get this far. You&rsquo;re doing remarkably well!</p>
          <p>Forget long-winded in-depth articles. It is a well-known fact that readers online graze, they dip in and out of text and don&rsquo;t read every word or paragraph. A good copywriter will use this to their advantage. If you&rsquo;ve got a long article it is beneficial to break it up into parts and post it up in different sections.</p>
          <p>The shorter the paragraph, the better. Readers, in their grazing capacity, will skip large sections of text in favour of shorter ones. Bullet points are a fabulous tool that should be used where possible because they are scannable, clear, quick to read.</p>
          <p>Just because you don&rsquo;t have pages and pages of copy doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to skimp on information or value. Simply provide links that readers can follow if they&rsquo;d like to find out more information, then they have that option available.</p>
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>Wrap up your page or blog post with something short and to-the-point. Lastly, don&rsquo;t forget to include a call to action, too.</p>
          <div class='boxout'>
            <h4>REMEMBER:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Important subjects don&rsquo;t necessarily need pages of copy</li>
              <li>An introduction should draw your reader in enough to make them want to read more</li>
              <li>Be straight to the point and be clear about the message you want to give</li>
              <li>Optimum length for a blog post is between 4-600 words</li>
            </ul>
