        <h1>Looking for a freelance writer?</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Am I who you&rsquo;ve been searching for?</h2>
        <h3>I&rsquo;m an ambitious individual who has five years&rsquo; experience editing, writing and drinking too much tea. </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I produce fresh and engaging copy for magazines, websites, blogs, print and just about anything else you can think of. </li>
          <li>I&rsquo;m a published author with a degree in Publishing, Media and Creative Writing.</li> <li>I&rsquo;ve worked as editor of a magazine and have written for large, national consumer magazines, smaller trade titles and have produced snappy promotional copy for local companies.</li> <li>Everything I write is thoroughly researched for your particular audience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Editing</h2>
        <img src="img/tmodernquilting.jpg" class="float-right">
        <p>I love what I do... and it shows. I&rsquo;ve led the development of a national consumer craft magazine, from developing branding and commissioning, through to choosing images for features and front covers, organising photo shoots, signing off pages for print and organising a magazine launch party. I am confident in heading up writing projects, have strong organisational skills and plenty of creative ideas. As a maintainer of my own freelance business, owner of five fluffy kitties and starter of my own own craft business I can, quite literally, herd cats.</p>

        <h2>Feature Writing</h2>
        <p>Skilled at researching and writing, I develop interesting, focussed and on-trend features and interviews for a wide variety of different topics and audiences. I am able to work to a brief and also offer my own ideas. Some of my more recent work has included features for Handmade Living, Vanilla and Chat! It&rsquo;s Fate. My main areas of interest here are lifestyle, beauty and crafts.</p>

        <h2>Copywriting</h2>
        <p>I generate dynamic content for print and the web. I have experience in copywriting for optometrists through to boat chartering companies. Recently I have been writing web content and social media for an interior design business and company that creates aromatherapy products.</p>

        <h2>Copyediting</h2>
        <img src="img/tinsidecrochet.jpg" class="float-right">
        <p>Skilled at copyediting, I transform dull, lifeless copy into informative and absorbing features, news pieces and blog posts for ongoing and one-off projects. Over the years I have copyedited for a variety of different magazines including Inside Crochet, Modern Quilting and Sew Hip.</p>

        <h2>Proofreading</h2>
        <p>With a wealth of proofreading experience, I&rsquo;m interested in all copy, whether it&rsquo;s a 400 word blog post, a 1,000 word feature or your latest novel. I&rsquo;ve got an eye for detail and a passion for making sure everything that passes my desk leaves of the highest quality.</p>
